# Book Comet: Front-End Coding Challenge

You are hired as a front-end developer to work on a new project: e-commerce called "bookcomet.com", for a book publisher.

You were designated to create a new front-end project for the new API:

https://publishing-house-service.herokuapp.com/docs

## Instructions:
* Interpret the above documentation and create a "CRUD" GUI for all operations described in the documentation above (with the exception of the health check);
* Note that in the API there are three search options: all books, by id and a query parameter where you can search all books by name (or part of the name);
* You must deliver your project in a public GitHub repository (no deployment is required);
* You must use Angular/Typescript;
* Don't forget to put comments in your code and use a well-defined directory structure;
* Provide good error handling;
* Unit tests are welcome;
* Optional: implement a fake auth/login screen. You don't need to implement a real auth system, just set a flag or something saying that the user is logged and allows access to the content.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
